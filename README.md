# Where's My Train?!

## What is this? What does it do?
Really simple Android app to fetch detailed predictions for every main Transport for London Underground (TfLU) line. Currently in a workable state, at an early stage.  
Sends requests to [tfl.php](trains.desousa.com.pt), relays them to the user in a rather basic UI (for now).  

## Features
Currently, the app simply displays two spinners, one with TfLU lines, the other with all stations on that line. Once the user selects a line, a request for detailed predictions for that station is made. This is displayed by platform in an expandable list view.  
Easy as pie to use, not particularly riveting to look at.  
Future development will include:

*	GUI improvements
*	Line and station status fetching
*	tfl.php development (not directly linked, but an essential part of it)

Yes that's right, I can only think of three things to work on for the app right now.
